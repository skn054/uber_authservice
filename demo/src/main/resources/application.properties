# ===============================================
# DATA SOURCE PROPERTIES
# ===============================================
# The URL for your MySQL database. It specifies the host (localhost), port (3306), and database name (splitwise_db).
# The parameters `useSSL=false` and `serverTimezone=UTC` are often needed for smooth connectivity.
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/uber?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC

# Your MySQL username and password
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
server.port=7474
# The class name of the MySQL JDBC driver. Spring Boot can often auto-detect this, but it's good practice to be explicit.
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver


# ===============================================
# JPA / HIBERNATE PROPERTIES
# ===============================================
# The SQL dialect tells Hibernate to generate syntax specific to MySQL.
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect

# This is a VERY important property for development.
# 'update': Hibernate will compare your @Entity models to the database schema and automatically add/modify tables and columns as needed.
# 'create': Drops and re-creates the schema every time the application starts. Good for testing from a clean slate.
# 'validate': Checks if the schema matches the entities and throws an error if it doesn't.
# 'none': Does nothing. This is the recommended setting for production.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate

# (Optional but useful for debugging) Show the actual SQL queries generated by Hibernate in the console.
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

# (Optional) Format the SQL shown in the console to be more readable.

#The flyway repair command is designed specifically for this situation. It inspects the flyway_schema_history table and does two things:
#It removes any entries for migrations that are marked as FAILED.
#It realigns the checksums for any applied migrations (not relevant here, but part of what it does).
#By removing the FAILED entry for version 2, it essentially unlocks the database, telling Flyway, "Okay, the human has fixed the problem, you can try migrating to version 2 again on the next run."
#Important: After it starts successfully, go back and remove or comment out the repair-on-migrate line. You don't want it running repair every single time you start the app.
